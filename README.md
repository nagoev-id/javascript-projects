## Project Structure

Each project in this repository follows a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── version-01/
│   ├── 01-js-use-basic-functionality/    # JavaScript implementation with basic functions
│   ├── 02-js-use-class/                 # JavaScript implementation using classes
│   ├── 03-ts-use-basic-functionality/    # TypeScript implementation with basic functions
│   ├── 04-ts-use-class/                 # TypeScript implementation using classes
│   └── preview.png                      # Preview image of the application
└── version-02/
    └── ...                              # Alternative implementations or improvements
```

This structured approach allows for:
- Learning different implementation styles (functional vs. object-oriented)
- Comparing JavaScript and TypeScript approaches
- Seeing the evolution of projects through different versions

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** - Core language for functionality
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe implementation alternative
- **React** - For select projects requiring component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **HTML5** - Structure and semantics
- **Various APIs** - For specific functionality (weather, translations, etc.)

## Purpose

This collection serves as:
- A learning resource for web development concepts
- A reference for implementation patterns
- A showcase of different approaches to solving common web development challenges
- A practical demonstration of modern front-end technologies
